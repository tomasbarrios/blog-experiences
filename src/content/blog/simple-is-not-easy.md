I remember my first years as a dev, I was full of ideas and lots of energy. I wanted to do all the ideas that came to my mind.

15 years have gone by, and now, whenever a new idea is proposed:
- I strive to do as little as possible
- I do scrutinate at least a copuple of reasons on why is maybe not needed
- I constantly question why it may be not that good
- I question myself: is this really supporting the long term vision?

As a dev/engineer or any role behind digital products, I strongly believe you should consider my suggestions. Your time is limited, if you dont have a very good reason to over work on something. Then don't.
